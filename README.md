# PaperBoat
*Harbour Masters port of Paper Mario 64*

> **About this fork** — Android fixes and a handheld-friendly launcher, tested on a
> Mangmi Air X (Android 14, Snapdragon 662 / Adreno 610). Work is on the
> [`airx`](../../tree/airx) branch; upstream is
> [HarbourMasters/PaperBoat](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/PaperBoat).
>
> - **Fixes:** startup crash after extraction, settings never saving, garbled
>   graphics on Adreno (GLES shader precision, via the
>   [libultraship fork](https://github.com/chris43123/libultraship/tree/airx);
>   Android heap pointer tagging), signed `char` on AArch64.
> - **Main menu:** Play / Settings / Mods / Saves, usable by touch or controller.
>   Settings covers render scale, anti-aliasing, frame rate, audio, touch controls,
>   gameplay options and cheats, written straight to `paperboat.cfg.json`.
> - **Pause menu:** press Back twice in-game for Resume / Settings / Quit to main menu.
>
> Build: `git clone --recursive -b airx https://github.com/chris43123/PaperBoat.git`,
> then see [docs/android-ios-web.md](docs/android-ios-web.md#android). No game
> data is included; you supply your own ROM.

### 3. Launch the Game!
#### Windows
* Extract the zip

# Configuration

### Default keyboard configuration
| N64 | A | B | Z | Start | Analog stick | C buttons | D-Pad |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Keyboard | X | C | Z | Space | WASD | Arrow keys | TFGH |

### Other shortcuts

### Graphics Backends
Currently, there are three rendering APIs supported: DirectX 11 (Windows), OpenGL (all platforms), and Metal (macOS). You can change which API to use in the `Settings` menu of the menubar, which requires a restart.

If you're having an issue with crashing, you can also change the API manually in the `paperboat.cfg.json` file by finding the `"Backend": {` section and updating the backend ID and name. Be sure to use one of the valid values:

- `0` = DirectX 11 (default on Windows)
- `1` = OpenGL
- `2` = Metal (default on macOS)

# Custom Assets

Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin (Note that PM64 is not fully supported at this time)**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)
